## Training Data
I have used sklearn data set and transform it to a Pandas dataframe.

# Data preprocessing
+ Verifying that data has no missing values and mean scaling our data for better precision.
+ Splitting our data to Train/test data .

# Training Model
Using Logistic Regression Algorithm 
P(y=1âˆ£X)= 1/(1+exp(-z)) .

# Testing Model
We have test the model using the testing part of data.
